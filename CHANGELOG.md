I had an idea to create a CHANGELOG, but I never updated it.
CHANGELOGS only really work well when they are auto-generated.
I will take this as a learning experience and know better for next time.

JUST GO THROUGH THE GIT LOG! SERIOUSLY.
I used git. I made decently good git comments throughout the developement
of the application. It'll take some time, but learn to git.
